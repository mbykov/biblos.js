#### attention to authentic grammar:

Morpheus is <b>not</b> a linguistic program. Morpheus is intended to help in reading and understanding the ancient text, but not to study the very questionable  theoretical construction of "language".

Linguistics is a science. Science refers to what it studies as an object. But that what "means," "wants to say," "strives", etc - is not an object. The language and the word are not objects. The word is part of an overheard conversation. A word taken out of context is a many-voiced chorus in which we do not hear individual voices.

The ancient and foreign cultural authors do not know the concept of "language". Do not know about nouns and adjectives. Their grammar is similar to what is now taught in theatrical high schools as the art of speech. Modern science should be put "out of brackets" - ἐποχή -  if you want to understand the ancient author. The motivation for epoche is not an anti-scientific orientation. It's just another direction of attention - another ἕξῐς.

Therefore, the Morpheus development takes into account first of all not the modern linguistic theory, but the grammar used by the author of the text, authentic grammar. First of all a grammar of Apollonius the Dyscolus.
